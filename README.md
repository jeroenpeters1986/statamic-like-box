## Features

This addon provides you with a Tag to generate a Facebook Like box with many options. 
You can place the tag in the templates yourself if you are using a 'vanilla' Statamic 
installation. If you use the Peak package with the Pagebuilder, the Like box can be 
added with just a click from the Control Panel!

## How to Install

You can search for this addon in the `Tools > Addons` section of the Statamic control panel and click **install**, or run the following command from your project root:

``` bash
composer require jeroenpeters1986/statamic-like-box
```

# Support
I love to share with the community. Nevertheless, coding/learning/updating takes a lot of work, time and effort.

If you like my software, feel free to [buy me a coffee or two with Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/jeroenpeters)
